		<ul class= 'aboutMe'> 
			<p class='aboutSara'>SB Design is a website to show off photography, Illustrations and art projects that I made. 

			<p class= 'aboutBurke'>I learned how to make Illustration and art from my college, Naresuan University. I love everything about art. I started doing art since the first time I laid hands on a coloring book and colored pencils. I practiced art as a hobby until I got in college. There I learned more about media design as well as drawing, painting, exhibitions, film, animation, photography, and graphic arts.</p>
			
			<p class='aboutSara'>For my last year of college I worked on an independent project. The project involved helping the Sgt. Maj. Thawee Folk Museum create interactive infographics for children using the Museumâ€™s already existing characters.  </p>

			<p class= 'aboutBurke'>I made this website to learn programmimg by using tools called HTML&CSS, Javascript and Git. I taught myself using a variety of sources such as Stack Overflow, Codecademy, and help from my programmer friends.
