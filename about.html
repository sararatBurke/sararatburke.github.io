			<p class='aboutSara'>SB design is a website to show of my photography, Illustration and art project that I made. 
			SB is came from "Sara Burke", my name. </p>

			<p class= 'aboutBurke'>I learned Illustration and arts from my college, I love everything about arts. I started an art work since I notice that coloring book and color pencils are exist. I was doing it as a hobby until I got in college. I learned more about media art. I got to try tools that make my art projects easier. I had learned drawing, painting, exhibition, film, animation, photography, and graphic arts.</p>
			
			<p class='aboutSara'>My art work, much like my life, it came out of my feeling, everystrokes has feeling itself, made the painting look alive. </p>

			<p class= 'aboutBurke'>I love taking photos. I have camera with me everywhere, because you never find the special moment all the time. Everytime when I take photos, I learned from every photos that I took. I felt free while I am taking photos.</p>

			<p class='aboutSara'>For my last years of college I picked to learn interactive project by myself, and made a project to telling some information of "Sgt. Maj. Thawee Folk museum" by using tools called Adobe Flash and Adobe Illustrator programs. I realized at that time I really love to do interactive design.</p>

			<p class= 'aboutBurke'>I made this website to learn programmimg by using tools called HTML&CSS, Javascript and Git. I have learned by myself from internet site to answer all of my questions. </p>
